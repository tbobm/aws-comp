# Milestone v0.1: Design Foundation & Component Redesign

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-09
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Transform the AWS Architecture Comparison Tool from functional to visually stunning. This milestone focuses on establishing the design foundation and redesigning all core UI components with smooth animations and Material Design theming.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Design Foundation

**Goal**: Establish complete design system, visual language, component patterns, and animation strategy using frontend-designer skill
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] **01-01: Design Foundation** - Animation system, enhanced Material Design theme, design patterns (26 min)
  - Installed Framer Motion with 7 reusable animation variants
  - Enhanced Material Design theme with cost-specific colors and 3-level elevation
  - Documented comprehensive design system with accessibility guidelines

**Details:**
- Created animation variants library: cardVariants, costChangeVariants, highlightVariants, fadeInUpVariants, interactiveControlVariants, tooltipVariants, errorVariants
- Added cost-specific semantic colors (savings=green, increase=red, neutral=gray)
- Implemented 3-level elevation shadow system (subtle, hover, active)
- Established responsive animation strategy (full desktop → simplified tablet → minimal mobile)
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility

### Phase 2: Component Redesign

**Goal**: Rebuild core UI components (comparison cards, cost breakdowns, parameter controls) with new design system
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] **02-01: Layout and Navigation Redesign** - ComparisonLayout, ServiceSelector, LandingPage with animations (8 min)
  - Applied cardVariants consistently across all card components
  - Implemented elevation system with shadow-subtle/shadow-hover
  - Added cost-specific highlights to comparison cards
- [x] **02-02: Forms Redesign** - S3ConfigForm and AuroraConfigForm with animated controls (98 min)
  - Applied interactiveControlVariants to all form inputs
  - Created errorVariants for validation error shake animations
  - Used AnimatePresence for smooth deployment type switching
- [x] **02-03: Charts and Cost Displays** - ComparisonChart, CostBreakdown, AuroraCostBreakdown with animations (15 min)
  - Applied Recharts animations with Material Design timing (500ms ease-in-out)
  - Added costChangeVariants to all cost values for animated updates
  - Used highlightVariants for total cost emphasis
  - Implemented staggered fadeInUpVariants for breakdown items

**Details:**
- All core UI components redesigned with consistent animation patterns
- Material Design color system applied throughout (neutral-*, primary-*, secondary-*)
- Interactive controls provide smooth feedback with scale and hover effects
- Cost visualizations animate value changes to draw attention to updates
- Service-specific color coding (primary-500 for generic, secondary-500 for Aurora)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Framer Motion variants approach over inline animations for better reusability
- Cost-specific semantic colors in theme (savings=green, increase=red, neutral=gray)
- 3-level elevation shadow system for visual hierarchy
- Responsive animation strategy with prefers-reduced-motion support
- Applied cardVariants consistently across all card-like components
- Used shadow-subtle/shadow-hover elevation instead of shadow-soft/shadow-medium
- Service-specific borders (primary-500 for generic, secondary-500 for Aurora)

**Issues Resolved:**

None - smooth execution throughout milestone.

**Issues Deferred:**

- Phase 3: Interactive Features (micro-interactions, hover effects, drill-down details)
- Phase 4: Polish & Responsiveness (mobile/tablet refinement)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - clean implementation following established patterns.
