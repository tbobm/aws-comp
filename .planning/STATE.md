## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Use frontend-designer skill for UI rework to create distinctive, production-grade interfaces
- Pure frontend redesign (no backend changes) to maintain existing architecture
- Interactive exploration as primary feature for engaging user experience

**Phase 1 Plan 1:**
- Framer Motion variants approach over inline animation definitions for better reusability
- Cost-specific semantic colors added to theme (savings=green, increase=red, neutral=gray)
- 3-level elevation shadow system (subtle, hover, active) for visual hierarchy
- Responsive animation strategy: full on desktop, simplified on tablet, minimal on mobile
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility
