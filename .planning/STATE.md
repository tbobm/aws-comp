# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

**Core value:** The comparison experience must be visually stunning and highly interactive — users should feel engaged exploring different configurations, with smooth animations and intuitive interactions that make cost analysis both informative and delightful.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Design Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Use frontend-designer skill for UI rework to create distinctive, production-grade interfaces
- Pure frontend redesign (no backend changes) to maintain existing architecture
- Interactive exploration as primary feature for engaging user experience

**Phase 1 Plan 1:**
- Framer Motion variants approach over inline animation definitions for better reusability
- Cost-specific semantic colors added to theme (savings=green, increase=red, neutral=gray)
- 3-level elevation shadow system (subtle, hover, active) for visual hierarchy
- Responsive animation strategy: full on desktop, simplified on tablet, minimal on mobile
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility

**Phase 2 Plan 1:**
- Applied cardVariants consistently across all card-like components for unified motion language
- Used shadow-subtle/shadow-hover elevation system instead of shadow-soft/shadow-medium for refined visual hierarchy
- Wrapped service icons in dedicated motion.div for playful rotate-on-hover interaction
- Applied cost-savings semantic color as background highlight to cheaper comparison option
