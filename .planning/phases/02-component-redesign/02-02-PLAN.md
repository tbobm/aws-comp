<objective>
Redesign configuration forms with interactive controls and visual feedback.

Purpose: Transform static form inputs into engaging interactive controls with smooth animations and clear visual states.
Output: S3ConfigForm and AuroraConfigForm with animated inputs, responsive feedback, and polished interactions.

**Tech stack available:** framer-motion@12.25.0
**Established patterns:** interactiveControlVariants, costChangeVariants, Material Design motion, 3-level elevation
**Prior accomplishments:** Layout components redesigned with animation system

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 1: Responsive animation strategy (full desktop, simplified tablet, minimal mobile)
- Phase 1: All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Phase 2 Plan 1: Consistent elevation system across components

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign S3ConfigForm with interactive controls</name>
  <files>src/components/S3ConfigForm.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Apply animation system to form controls:
  - Wrap form container in motion.div with fadeInUpVariants
  - Apply interactiveControlVariants to all input fields (storage, PUT/GET requests, data transfer)
  - Use interactiveControlVariants on select dropdown for storage tier
  - Add motion.div wrapper with costChangeVariants around tier description (updates when tier changes)
  - Apply focus ring with primary-500 color and transition-quick on inputs
  - Use error state animation: shake effect on validation errors (create errorVariants if needed using Material Design motion principles)
  - Replace gray color classes with neutral-* from Material Design theme
  - Add subtle shadow elevation on input focus (shadow-subtle to shadow-hover)

  What to avoid: Don't modify validation logic, don't change form state management (useState for errors), don't alter S3_TIER_METADATA usage. Keep existing onChange handlers.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build passes, form inputs animate on focus, tier description transitions smoothly on change, validation errors show with animation</verify>
  <done>S3ConfigForm has animated inputs, smooth transitions between states, clear visual feedback on interaction, validation errors animated</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Redesign AuroraConfigForm with animated sections</name>
  <files>src/components/AuroraConfigForm.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Apply consistent animation patterns:
  - Wrap form container in motion.div with fadeInUpVariants
  - Apply interactiveControlVariants to all inputs and selects (deployment type, instance type, storage, I/O)
  - Use layoutTransitionConfig for AnimatePresence when switching between deployment types (serverless vs provisioned)
  - Add costChangeVariants to instance description text (updates when instance type changes)
  - Apply elevation changes on focus (shadow-subtle → shadow-hover)
  - Use transition-quick for all color transitions
  - Group related inputs in motion.div containers for better visual flow
  - Replace gray colors with neutral-* theme colors

  What to avoid: Don't modify conditional rendering logic (serverless vs provisioned sections), don't change validation, don't alter AURORA_INSTANCE_METADATA structure. Maintain all existing form functionality.
  </action>
  <verify>Form switches smoothly between deployment types, inputs animate on interaction, descriptions update with transitions, npm run build succeeds</verify>
  <done>AuroraConfigForm has polished animations, deployment type switching smooth, inputs responsive, consistent with S3ConfigForm style</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] Both forms render correctly
- [ ] Input animations work on focus/blur
- [ ] Validation errors display with animation
- [ ] Tier/instance descriptions transition smoothly
- [ ] Forms still submit correctly (onChange handlers work)
- [ ] No console errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- S3ConfigForm and AuroraConfigForm redesigned with animation system
- Interactive controls respond with smooth feedback
- Visual hierarchy improved with elevation and colors
- Existing form functionality preserved
- Consistent animation patterns across both forms
</success_criteria>
