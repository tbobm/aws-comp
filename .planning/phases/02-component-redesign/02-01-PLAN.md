<objective>
Redesign core layout and navigation components using Phase 1 design system.

Purpose: Apply animation variants, enhanced Material Design theme, and visual hierarchy to primary structural components.
Output: ComparisonLayout, ServiceSelector, and LandingPage with smooth animations, cost-specific colors, and interactive polish.

**Tech stack available:** framer-motion@12.25.0
**Established patterns:** Animation variants library (cardVariants, fadeInUpVariants, etc.), Material Design motion principles, cost-specific semantic colors, 3-level elevation shadows
**Key files:** src/utils/animations.ts (7 reusable animation variants)

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 1: Framer Motion variants approach over inline animations for reusability
- Phase 1: Cost-specific semantic colors (savings=green, increase=red, neutral=gray)
- Phase 1: Responsive animation strategy (full desktop, simplified tablet, minimal mobile)
- Phase 1: All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign ComparisonLayout with animated cards and cost highlights</name>
  <files>src/components/ComparisonLayout.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Replace static structure with animated version:
  - Wrap entire layout in motion.div with fadeInUpVariants
  - Apply cardVariants to header card (line 31-37) with whileHover and initial/animate
  - Apply cardVariants to both config cards (lines 39-55) with hover effects
  - Apply cardVariants to cost comparison section (line 57)
  - Use highlightVariants on savings callout (lines 79+) with cost-savings color classes
  - Add layoutTransitionConfig to grid layouts for smooth resizing
  - Replace shadow-soft/shadow-medium with shadow-subtle/shadow-hover from Phase 1
  - Use cost-specific colors: bg-cost-savings-light for cheaper option, bg-cost-increase-light for more expensive
  - Import motion and animation variants at top

  What to avoid: Don't change ComparisonLayoutProps interface, don't modify calculateCost logic, don't alter existing className patterns (just enhance with animations). Maintain all existing functionality.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, no TypeScript errors, layout still functional with smooth entrance animations</verify>
  <done>ComparisonLayout renders with animated cards, savings highlight pulses, hover effects work, responsive animations active</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Redesign ServiceSelector with interactive breadcrumb</name>
  <files>src/components/ServiceSelector.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Add micro-interactions to navigation:
  - Wrap entire component in motion.nav with fadeInUpVariants
  - Apply interactiveControlVariants to each service link button
  - Add whileHover and whileTap from cardVariants to service cards
  - Use transition-quick class for color transitions
  - Replace existing hover states with elevation changes (shadow-subtle → shadow-hover)
  - Add motion.div wrapper with layoutTransitionConfig for smooth layout shifts
  - Ensure keyboard navigation still works (keep focus states)

  What to avoid: Don't change router navigation logic, don't remove accessibility features (focus indicators, keyboard nav). Keep all existing Link functionality.
  </action>
  <verify>Navigation links animate on hover, breadcrumb transitions smoothly, keyboard navigation works, npm run build passes</verify>
  <done>ServiceSelector has smooth hover animations, interactive feedback on click, maintains accessibility</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Redesign LandingPage with staggered service cards</name>
  <files>src/components/LandingPage.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Create engaging entrance animation:
  - Wrap hero section in motion.div with fadeInUpVariants
  - Apply cardVariants to each service card with stagger effect (use staggerChildren in parent container)
  - Add costChangeVariants to cost estimates if displayed
  - Use elevation system: shadow-subtle at rest, shadow-hover on hover, shadow-active on tap
  - Apply transition-normal to color transitions
  - Wrap service grid in motion.div with layoutTransitionConfig for responsive shifts
  - Use interactiveControlVariants for "Compare Now" buttons

  What to avoid: Don't modify service registry structure, don't change routing logic, don't alter responsive grid breakpoints. Maintain existing card content and layout structure.
  </action>
  <verify>Service cards stagger in on page load, hover effects smooth, buttons respond to interactions, npm test passes if tests exist</verify>
  <done>LandingPage has polished entrance animations, service cards feel interactive, visual hierarchy clear with elevation</done>
</task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] All three components render correctly in browser
- [ ] Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- [ ] Navigation still works (ServiceSelector links, LandingPage cards)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Visual hierarchy clear with cost-specific colors and elevation

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- ComparisonLayout, ServiceSelector, and LandingPage redesigned with animation system
- Framer Motion variants applied consistently
- No TypeScript errors or build failures
- Existing functionality preserved (navigation, comparison logic)
- Responsive animations work on desktop/tablet/mobile
</success_criteria>
