# Roadmap: AWS Architecture Comparison Tool

## Overview

Transform the AWS Architecture Comparison Tool from functional to visually stunning. This journey focuses on pure frontend redesign — using the frontend-designer skill to create a distinctive, production-grade interface with smooth animations and interactive exploration features that make cost analysis both informative and delightful.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Design Foundation** - Create design system, visual language, and animation strategy
- [ ] **Phase 2: Component Redesign** - Rebuild core UI components with new design system
- [ ] **Phase 3: Interactive Features** - Add micro-interactions, hover effects, and exploration features
- [ ] **Phase 4: Polish & Responsiveness** - Refine mobile/tablet experience and final visual polish

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Design Foundation
**Goal**: Establish complete design system, visual language, component patterns, and animation strategy using frontend-designer skill
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Research**: Likely (frontend-designer skill application, design system decisions)
**Research topics**: Design patterns for cost comparison UIs, animation libraries compatible with React 18/Tailwind v4, Material Design integration approaches
**Plans**: 1 (complete)
**Status**: Complete

Plans:
- [x] **01-01: Design Foundation** - Animation system, enhanced Material Design theme, design patterns (26 min)
  - Installed Framer Motion with 7 reusable animation variants
  - Enhanced Material Design theme with cost-specific colors and 3-level elevation
  - Documented comprehensive design system with accessibility guidelines

### Phase 2: Component Redesign
**Goal**: Rebuild core UI components (comparison cards, cost breakdowns, parameter controls) with new design system
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Unlikely (building on existing React components and established patterns from Phase 1)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- TBD (will be defined during phase planning)

### Phase 3: Interactive Features
**Goal**: Implement micro-interactions, hover effects, drill-down details, and dynamic filtering for engaging exploration
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (implementing interactions defined in Phase 1 design)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- TBD (will be defined during phase planning)

### Phase 4: Polish & Responsiveness
**Goal**: Refine mobile/tablet experience with polished touch interactions and final visual polish
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Research**: Unlikely (refinement of existing implementation)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- TBD (will be defined during phase planning)

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
